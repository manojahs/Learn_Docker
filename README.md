# Learn_Docker

What is the challege?  
Code works in my machine not in other machine to resolve this issue we use Docker Container

Basically its Packaging solution to simplify the deployment (it contains like code, solution, instruction, operatinig system everything which need to run your application that is being stored in the container same container works in local machine and once u put into server it will works there too)


1)Container are built on top of Images.  
2)Containers are created using images.  
3)Image which containes like dot net applicaton executable files to run the dot net app.  
4)For using the nodejs/sql/dotnet app for any application run in docker we have a special application called docker hub where we will get all the programming languages as Images  
5)Docker Images are standalone executable files which is used to create a container. and docker images are sharable and portable  

Images
---------
Images of docker build by Layers 

<img width="916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fca352c6-461b-496c-bac4-09d3182040d3" />  

To run the dot net application we need to create several layers and finally we need to put Final Layer inside the container

Docker vs VM
------------------

Each VM containes its own OS so which will make heavier so in docker container for each container we will be not having seperate OS for each thats why it will be Lightweight.  

Containers takes less memory when compare to VM  

Search this and click on sdk copy the command paste it in cmd prompt

To get the id of all the container and to remove all the container
----------------------------------  
$(docker ps -a -q)  
To remove all the container: docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)  

To get the id of all the images and to remove all the images  
-------------------------------------
docker images -q
docker rmi $(docker images -q)  

# We can run 2 different container with same container port number but here we should use different host number 
like 
docker run -d -p <host-port>:<container-port> image-name

docker run -d -p 8080:80 app1
docker run -d -p 8081:80 app2

Docker usage
-----------

Portable
Cost Effective
Ability to run anywhere 
TEst and rollback for deployment

Docker Taxanomy
-----------------

Docker taxonomy refers to the classification and organization of Docker's components and how they interact within the container ecosystem.
ðŸ”¹ 1. Docker Image
ðŸ”¹ 2. Docker Container
ðŸ”¹ 3. Dockerfile
ðŸ”¹ 4. Docker Engine
    The core runtime that builds and runs containers
    Includes:
    Docker Daemon (dockerd)
    Docker CLI (docker)
 5. Docker Compose
    Tool for defining and running multi-container apps
    Uses a docker-compose.yml file
   ðŸ“Œ Helps manage services like web + DB together
ðŸ”¹ 6. Docker Volumes
   Used to persist data outside the container lifecycle
   Shared between host and containers, or between containers
  ðŸ“Œ Used for databases, file storage, etc.
ðŸ”¹ 7. Docker Networks
    Isolated communication layers for containers
    Enables container-to-container communication
    ðŸ“Œ Example: Connecting your app and database securely
8. Docker Registry
    A storage and distribution system for Docker images
    Examples:
    Docker Hub (default)
    Amazon ECR
    GitHub Container Registry
    ðŸ“Œ Like a GitHub for container images
